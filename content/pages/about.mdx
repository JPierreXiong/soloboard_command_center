## Afterglow: Preserving the Last Glow of Warmth in the Digital Wasteland

### Our Origin: Solving the Paradox of Forgetting

In the 21st century, we live dual lives: one physical, defined by breath and heartbeat; the other digital, defined by code, pixels, and encryption keys. We store memories on social media, essential documents in the cloud, and wealth in digital wallets.

However, a harsh reality is often ignored: when life ends in the physical world, our digital presence often falls into a permanent silence. Locked by master passwords and inaccessible private keys, these assets become "Digital Wastelands"—unreachable territories that fade away with time.

### The Birth of Afterglow: Bridging Time and Space

We chose the name **Afterglow** because we believe a person's value should not cease the moment their breathing stops. Like the gentle glow that lingers after the sun sets, your legacy should continue to illuminate and guide those you love.

Afterglow is not just about "data transfer"; it is about honoring a final trust. We are building a bridge—a bridge that connects your digital existence with those who matter most, ensuring that your accumulated wisdom, unsent letters to children, and precious family memories reach their destination safely, even when you can no longer speak for yourself.

### Our Technical Foundation: Zero-Knowledge Encryption & Physical Fragmentation

To ensure this "afterglow" never falls into the wrong hands, we have adopted the most rigorous technical standards:

**Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: We insist that your data is encrypted before it ever leaves your browser. Afterglow servers never see your raw passwords or files. This means that even we cannot peek into your privacy.

**180-Day Heartbeat Detection**: To balance convenience and security, we designed a periodic active confirmation system for Free users. This is like a silent contract: as long as you are present, the vault remains closed.

**Fragment A/B Physical Splitting**: For Pro users, we introduced the ShipAny physical mailing solution. By splitting encryption keys into digital and physical components, we fundamentally eliminate the risk of a single point of failure.

### Our Vision: Dignity in the Digital Age

At Afterglow, we serve not just your assets, but your dignity. We want everyone to face the future with peace of mind, knowing that:

- Your hard-earned encrypted wealth will be safely delivered
- Those letters to your children that you never got to send will reach them
- Those precious family memories will be preserved and shared

Afterglow—preserving the digital warmth that never fades.
