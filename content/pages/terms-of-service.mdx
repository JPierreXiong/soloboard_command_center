## 1. Introduction and Acceptance of Terms

Welcome to Afterglow (accessible via [https://www.digitalheirloom.app](https://www.digitalheirloom.app)). Afterglow provides a high-security platform for digital asset custody and automated inheritance distribution. By accessing our service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use our service.

## 2. Use of the Service

Afterglow provides a "Dead Man's Switch" mechanism to manage digital assets. You agree to use this service in accordance with all applicable laws, particularly regarding the legality of the assets you store and the inheritance laws of your jurisdiction.

## 3. User Accounts and Heartbeat Obligation

To access features like vault management, you must create an account. You are responsible for account security. Specifically, **Free Tier** users must perform a "Heartbeat Check-in" every 180 days to confirm their status. Failure to do so will trigger the inheritance process.

## 4. Zero-Knowledge and Intellectual Property

Afterglow uses **Zero-Knowledge Encryption**. We do not store your master password or private keys. You are solely responsible for your credentials. All platform software and UI design remain the property of Afterglow. We claim no ownership over the content stored in your private vault.

## 5. Subscription System and Payments

We operate on a subscription model (Free, Base, Pro). Payments are securely handled by third-party providers (e.g., Stripe). Prices are subject to change with notice. You agree to pay all charges associated with your selected plan.

## 6. Refund Policy

Purchases are generally non-refundable once storage has been allocated. However, if a task fails due to internal system errors (e.g., failed vault creation), a credit or partial refund may be issued. For billing disputes, contact us at support@digitalheirloom.app within 14 days.

## 7. Prohibited Activities

You agree not to: store illegal data or malware; attempt to reverse engineer our encryption logic or BIP39 implementation; use automated scripts to bypass heartbeat requirements or decryption limits.

## 8. Privacy and Data Collection

We collect minimal data: Email for account management and heartbeat logs. Because of our Zero-Knowledge design, we cannot access the raw data inside your vaults. Please refer to our Privacy Policy for more details.

## 9. Disclaimer of Warranties and Administration

The service is provided "as is." We make no warranties regarding 100% availability of third-party networks. Administrators reserve the right to grant compensation (time or decryption resets) under special circumstances; these hold no cash value.

## 10. Limitation of Liability and Changes

Afterglow shall not be liable for any damages arising from "premature release" due to missed check-ins or loss of master passwords. We reserve the right to update these Terms at any time; continued use signifies acceptance.

## 11. Contact Information

If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at: **support@digitalheirloom.app**
