## Disclaimer for Afterglow (Digital Heirloom)

### 1. Purpose and Technical Scope

Afterglow is designed as a high-security technical tool to facilitate the management and automated distribution of digital legacies. Our platform is intended to help users organize their digital presence and ensure asset continuity in a responsible manner. It is not a substitute for professional legal or estate planning advice.

### 2. Zero-Knowledge and Data Recovery

We employ a Zero-Knowledge encryption architecture. Afterglow does not host, store, or have access to your raw passwords, private keys, or vault contents. Users are solely responsible for safeguarding their Master Passwords and physical fragments (Fragment A/B). We cannot recover or reset access to your data if these credentials are lost.

### 3. User Responsibility and Legal Compliance

Users are solely responsible for ensuring that their use of Afterglow complies with: (1) The Terms of Service of any third-party platforms (e.g., crypto exchanges, cloud storage); (2) Inheritance and probate laws in their jurisdiction; (3) Any applicable local or international regulations. Afterglow shall not be held liable for the legal invalidity of a digital transfer in any specific region.

### 4. Heartbeat and Automated Trigger

The "Dead Man's Switch" mechanism relies on user-defined heartbeat frequencies. Afterglow is not responsible for "premature release" of data caused by the user's failure to perform a check-in, nor for any damages resulting from delayed release due to network or email delivery issues beyond our control.

### 5. No Affiliation

Afterglow is an independent platform and is not affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with Google, Apple, Microsoft, any cryptocurrency exchanges, or their subsidiaries. All product names, logos, and brands are property of their respective owners.

### 6. Service Availability and Accuracy

Afterglow is provided on an "as is" basis. We make no warranties regarding: (1) The 100% continuous availability of the service; (2) The successful delivery of alerts via third-party email providers; (3) The long-term compatibility of the service with future OS or browser versions.

### 7. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Afterglow and its operators shall not be liable for any damages arising from: (1) Loss of access to vaults due to user negligence; (2) Unauthorized access by third parties who have obtained the user's Master Password; (3) Failure of beneficiaries to correctly combine Fragment A and B.
