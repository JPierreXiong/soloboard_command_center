        "question": "How does SoloBoard connect to my websites?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Is it safe to share my API keys?",
        "answer": "Yes. We prioritize security above all else. All keys are encrypted using AES-256 and stored in a secure Neon database. We only request Read-Only permissions, so your funds and configurations are never at risk."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does SoloBoard slow down my website's performance?",
        "answer": "Not at all. SoloBoard communicates directly with the platform APIs (like Stripe's servers). We do not load any scripts on your actual website, ensuring your page speed remains 100% unaffected."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I manage more than 10 websites?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. While our standard Pro plan covers up to 10 sites, our Studio plan offers unlimited monitoring for larger portfolios and agencies."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why choose SoloBoard over free alternatives?",
        "answer": "While you can check these platforms individually for free, SoloBoard saves you the most valuable asset you have: Time. We consolidate everything into a high-performance, mobile-ready dashboard that a single browser tab simply can't match."
      },
      {
        "question": "What platforms do you support?",
        "answer": "We currently support Google Analytics 4 (GA4) for traffic analytics, Stripe and Lemon Squeezy for payment processing, Shopify for e-commerce, and custom uptime monitoring. More integrations are added regularly based on user requests."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often does the data refresh?",
        "answer": "Free plan users get hourly updates. Pro plan users enjoy near real-time synchronization (every 5-10 minutes) to ensure you never miss critical changes in your business metrics."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I cancel my subscription anytime?",
